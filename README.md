DEPLOYER
========

### This deployer allows you to deploy fast and easy to your webserver.

Very cool if you are using : NGINX & GUNICORN

You need to use a directory format like : ```/projects/client/client_name/project/source```

requirements :

- Fabric
- Jinja


This is being set free from Private so it may take time to free out all the mess from my private repo


TO INSTALL
==========

```
pip install webdeployment
```

MILESTONE/ROADMAP

- I want to make it more customizable
